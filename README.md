# toDoList

## Description

This ToDo app was built using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. It was built as an exercise to interact with the DOM, manipulate elements, create events, etc.

## How to run?

Since this was a simple exercise on Vanilla JS, I am only running it using the `open with live server` plugin from VS Code.

## Storage

The todods are beign kept in LocalStorage.
